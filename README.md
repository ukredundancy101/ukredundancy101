# UK Redundancy 101

**DISCLAIMER**: this document is not legal advice. If you need more formal advice, you can talk to [ACAS](https://www.acas.org.uk/contact) (free), [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) (free, generally very overloaded) or a solicitor (paid). The [UK government also has a page with an overview of redundancy](https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights).

A very high level overview of the UK redundancy process.

## What is redundancy?

Formally, redundancy is a means for an employer to dismiss an employee because they no longer are reducing the amount of work they need performed. Under UK law, there are specific requirements for how an employer can make people redundant; if these requirements are not followed, the dismissal is "unfair" and the employer may have to pay compensation to the employee (or in extreme circumstances, re-hire them, but that is very uncommon because the relationship has probably irretrievably broken down by that point).

## Two years service

If you have been continuously employed by your employer for less than two years, you have very limited rights in the UK - you can essentially be dismissed for any reason or none. The only exception is if your employer is discriminating against you on grounds of sex, race etc or for claiming a legal right (minimum wage etc).

Note that if your employment has moved from one company to another while you still did essentially the same role, that counts as continuous service. This commonly happens when one company purchases another or similar.

## Roles are redundant, not people

One of the fundamental principles of the UK redundancy is the _roles_ are redundant, not people. For example, if Acme Manufacturing Ltd employs Alice, Bob and Eve as widget makers and wishes to reduce their workforce, they cannot simply say "Bob is redundant" - instead, they must:

1. Determine that one widget maker role is redundant.
2. Define the criteria by which widget makers will be evaluated.
3. Evaluate all the employees undertaking the widget maker role against those criteria.

### What is a "role"?

There is no legal definition here, but the definition must make sense from a business perspective: Acme Manufacturing Ltd couldn't say Alice and Eve perform the role of "making red widgets" and Bob performs the role of "making blue widgets" unless the skills needed to make red widgets are significantly different from those needed to make blue widgets.

### What criteria can an employer use?

Other than some criteria which are automatically deemed to be unfair (sex, race etc), an employer can use any criteria which are "fair"; borrowing from the [UK government site](https://www.gov.uk/staff-redundant/compulsory-redundancy), typical criteria include:

* skills - e.g. which employees are trained to use the latest SuperDooper widget manufacturing machine
* performance - e.g. the rate at which employees produce widgets
* disciplinary record - self explanatory

### Practical effect

Practically, an employer can choose the definition of roles and the criteria used for each role to significantly influence the final result. This is reasonable, but they must ensure that any redundancies are fair.

## Consultancy

If an employer is proposing making 20 or more than people redundant (within in 90 day period) at a single establishment, they must consult with the employees for at least 30 days before making any redundancies; the length of consultantion increases to 45 days if they propose making 100 people redundant. What is a single "establishment" is again not specifically defined in law, but it must make sense within the employer's business.

If there is not a recognized trade union within the company, the employees must be given a chance to elect people to represent them during the consultancy process.

### What does the consultancy process involve?

The consultancy process _should_ be a two way dialogue, where the employer explains the reasons and mechanics for the redundancies, and then listens to both employee concerns and any employee suggestions as to how the effect of redundancies could be minimised. Practically, don't expect too much to change during the consultancy process.

## Redundancy payments

If you are made redundant, your employer must:

* Give you notice, and pay you your normal wage for the notice period. The notice period is the _minimum_ of anything defined in your contract and (effectively) one week per year you've worked for the employer (up to 12 weeks).
  * Pay any bonuses etc which would normally become due in the notice period; typically though bonuses are "at the company's discretion" so don't necessarily expect to get these even if they are customary in your business.
* Give you [statutory redundancy pay](https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/redundancy-pay) - basically this comes out to a week's pay per year of service, or a week and a half per year of service if you are 41 or over, but is capped at Â£643 per week.
  * This payment is tax-free.
